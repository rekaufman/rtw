We met in November 2013 (thanks, OkCupid!) at Piccolo Cafe, two blocks from where we now live in New York. Rebecca wrote in her profile, under the "Message me if..." heading: "Message me if you want to talk about my family's new puppy."

Tavi's first message to Rebecca was about Rebecca's family's new puppy, Shadow - good thing we both love dogs! We got engaged on April 15, 2017 and look forward to celebrating our wedding with all of you, one year later.
